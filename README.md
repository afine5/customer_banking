# customer_banking

### Assignment

Create a customer banking system.

### Struggles

While I got things working, I found holes in the experience that I tried to rectify (like not providing an error state if the user puts something in other than a number). But every time I tried to add the error in the loop, the whole thing broke.

### Takeaways

After the last assignment and some creative liberties taken (and the poor score to show for it), I did my best to follow the directions line for line. While I still disagree that not having an error state is a problem in the experience, I hope my efforts to follow the directions to the line work out for me.
